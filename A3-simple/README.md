## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?




What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?

Shakila- I learned that linked lists look simple in theory by doing all those activities we were doing in class but theyâ€™re tricky to get right in code! Because we have to think carefully about every pointer and always keep the head, tail, and size in sync.

Kiara- I have definitelly learned more about the different functions of a linked lists and how they work. Specifically I now better understand how to reassign pointers and add or remove elements from a linked list.
